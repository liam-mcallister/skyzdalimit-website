## 1. Description

A website that allows users to find information on Skyzdalimit, send an enquiry and download a volunteer registration form.

Moving on from projects, I decided that I was ready to develop a website for a client. In order to find one I thought that it would be a good idea to go to https://www.charitycommissionni.org.uk/ and download their charity spreadsheet. I was now able to find charities that have no website and using the provided email address, could contact them and see if they were interested in having one developed.

After Skyzdalimit expressed their interest, I created and sent them a questionnaire in order to establish what they wanted from a website. With this information I designed a mock-up using Figma, which I allowed the client to review and offer their opinions on.

Once the design was approved, I got to work with development on the website. I decided to develop this website using HTML, Sass and vanilla JavaScript as I felt that the use of frameworks and libraries would be unnecessary and potentially slow down the website.

Out of the box solutions such as Mapbox for the map, Glider.js for the cast carousel and baguetteBox.js for the gallery were used to help speed up development with minimal tradeoffs in regards to page load speed.

I made the decision to incorporate Netlify into the website as it would take care of the hosting and also allow me to utilize the Netlify Forms feature so the client can receive enquiries to their email, with no need for a dedicated backend and no additional cost to the client.

Developing this website allowed me to use a web app bundler for the first time. After some research, I went with Parcel.js for its minimal configuration and fast performance. Overall, my experience with Parcel.js was great and will use it in my future projects. I especially liked that it offers live reloading and simple asset bundling/minification.

Throughout the entire process I would communicate weekly with the client in order to keep them updated with my progress, offer them the opportunity to make minor changes if they wished and to ask for whatever content I needed to add to the website.

Going forward, I would like to incorporate a headless CMS into the website as it would give the client the ability to login and make their own changes to the website. I have already discussed this with the client and they have expressed interest in adding this functionality.
